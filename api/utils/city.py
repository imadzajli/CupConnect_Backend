    "m": "Vibrant and bustling, Marrakech has an energy all its own (there's a reason it's one of Morocco's most well-visited cities). To get right to the heart of things, wind your way through its busy Medina—the walled, historic neighborhood that serves as the city's main square. Fair warning, it can be a bit intense, but while there, you can fully immerse yourself browsing souks for local wares, taking in the Moorish architecture, and filling up on street food. On the slower end of things, places like Le Jardin Secret, Bahia Palace, and the famed technicolor Jardin Majorelle give some breathing room alongside seriously gorgeous scenery. And you can always take a full time-out at one of Marrakech's many luxe spas or relaxing hammams. Check out must-sees below for even more to explore.",
    "a": "Soak up the sun on the well-maintained beaches of Agadir, southern Morocco's most-visited city. Palm-lined boulevards and beachfront bars add a decidedly Western-resort feel, amplified by the large number of Europeans who flock here in the winter months. It’s all about laid-back relaxation in Agadir, so ride a camel, rent a beach buggy, check out the Suq al-Had market or take the 20-minute walk up to the ruins of the Agadir Kasbah for expansive city views if you’re taking a break from the beach.",
    "c": "Today Casablanca is a large, modern city, but the former French colonial post still allows myriad movie moments for those who want to revisit love in the medina and Old City. Casa (as locals call it) isn’t too touristy, but it’s the most cosmopolitan and Western-feeling city in Morocco. Visit The King Hassan II Mosque and Casa's Medina.",
    "r": "Morocco's coastal capital since 1912, Rabat has just over a million people. Modern and even reserved by Moroccan standards, the city also has many fascinating historic sites, including the picturesque Kasbah of the Udayas, built in the mid-12th century. The unique Hassan Tower, begun at the end of the 12th century, was meant to have the world's largest minaret, but was never completed. Just opposite the tower lies the 20th-century Mausoleum of Mohammed V, another of the city's main attractions.",
    "t": "Located on the Strait of Gibraltar where Africa meets Europe, Tangier has long held strategic importance. Ruled through the centuries by waves of conquerors including Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs and Portuguese, the city is more than two and a half millennia old, making it one of North Africa's most ancient. The medina, kasbah, bazaars and souks are among the country's most vibrant, and the beaches are excellent. In the last century, Tangier became a hot spot for the international jet set.",
    "f": "The oldest university in the world isn’t Oxford or the Sorbonne—it’s the University of Al-Karaouine, and you’ll find it in Fes el Bali. This walled city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, will transport you back to medieval times. Visit the ancient maze-like quarters of the Medina to Fes el-Bali and the four imposing Gates of Fes, with their distinctive Moroccan tile work. You can walk, or, if you're brave, take a taxi—the daredevil drivers will have you hanging on for dear life.",
