The name khli'i springs from the term to preserve something for a long time until it becomes ready to be consumed. This type of food is made of kaddid, which is a combination of beef ribs, salt, altsfirh, cumin, coriander, and oil. We cut the beef ribs into thin pieces, mix with the spices and oil, and hang the pieces in a sunny place for up to three days or until they are dried. To make the khli'i, we put the kaddid pieces in fire, then we add a boiled robe with one letter of oil. Finally, it is put in a glass bottle in the refrigerator. It is served hot for lunch or dinner or, as some people prefer, with tea in the morning.",

A favorite dish for important Fassi ceremonies and meetings, it demonstrates a mixture of cooking tradition and art that typifies the culture of Fes. Bastilla is prepared with chicken (or fish), phyllo pastry leaves, eggs, and pecan. After we cook one chicken with onions and spices, we separate the chicken from the spices and add eight or more eggs. Then, we put one pastry leaf in a dish and add the onions and eggs. In the opposite direction we put another leaf and we add the chicken, cut in small pieces. Then we put a third pastry leaf and we add the pecan. After covering the dish completely with a fourth pastry leaf, we bake the bastilla in an oven. After it is cooked and the pastry is browned, we decorate it with sugar and cinnamon.",

Fruity olive oil, tomatoes, cumin, ginger, and herbs create the base. As the mix bubbles over an open burner, small shrimp are tossed in to cook for a few minutes before an egg is quickly poached or scrambled in the brew. Served with a bottomless glass of sweet mint tea and plenty of fresh, crusty Moroccan bread for dipping, this is the perfect breakfast or lunch by the seashore. A number of restaurants serve shrimp with eggs around the port, but the best place to have it isn’t a restaurant at all. Instead, head deep inside the port itself and grab one of the makeshift tables. If you see vendors hustling between tables and mostly Moroccans filling the benches, you’ll know you’re in the right spot.",

But some things are universal, like the extensive cleaning process — some claim to rinse the snails at least seven times to rid them of dirt and debris. Then the mollusks are slowly boiled in a liquid that contains as many as 15 herbs and spices, things like cumin seeds, licorice root, mint leaves, thyme, and ginger.",

Couscous with seven vegetables is eaten throughout Morocco, and is sometimes referred to as couscous bidaoui, a reference to the name of Casablanca in Arabic. The number seven is arbitrary, really — in Arabic, the phrase “seven vegetables” just sounds better than “six,” “eight,” or “10.” The dish itself can include as many or as few vegetables as the cook prefers and still be legit.",
