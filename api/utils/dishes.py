The name khli'i springs from the term to preserve something for a long time until it becomes ready to be consumed. This type of food is made of kaddid, which is a combination of beef ribs, salt, altsfirh, cumin, coriander, and oil. We cut the beef ribs into thin pieces, mix with the spices and oil, and hang the pieces in a sunny place for up to three days or until they are dried. To make the khli'i, we put the kaddid pieces in fire, then we add a boiled robe with one letter of oil. Finally, it is put in a glass bottle in the refrigerator.

After we cook one chicken with onions and spices, we separate the chicken from the spices and add eight or more eggs. Then, we put one pastry leaf in a dish and add the onions and eggs. In the opposite direction we put another leaf and we add the chicken, cut in small pieces. Then we put a third pastry leaf and we add the pecan.
